# Go Backend Setup and Installation Guide

This document will guide you through the process of setting up and running a Go backend project on your local system.

---

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have the following installed:
- **Git**: To clone the project repository.
- **Go**: (Golang) The programming language used in this project.

If you do not have Go installed, follow the installation instructions below.

---

## Step 1: Installing Go

1. **Download Go**  
   Visit the [official Go website](https://go.dev/dl/) and download the appropriate installer for your operating system.

   - **Windows**: Download the `.msi` installer and run it.
   - **macOS**: Download the `.pkg` installer and run it.
   - **Linux**: Download the `.tar.gz` archive and extract it to `/usr/local`.

2. **Verify Installation**  
   Open a terminal and run the following command:
   ```bash
   go version
   ```
   You should see the installed version of Go.

3. **Set Go Environment Variables (Optional)**  
   Add the Go binary to your system's `PATH` (if not done automatically during installation):
   ```bash
   export PATH=$PATH:/usr/local/go/bin
   ```
   Add this line to your shell configuration file (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, or equivalent) for permanent access.

## Step 2: Clone the Repository

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to clone the project:
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/directory
   ```

2. Clone the repository using Git:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```
   Replace `<repository_url>` with the URL of the GitHub repository (e.g., `https://github.com/username/repo.git`).

3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd repo
   ```

---

## Step 3: Install Dependencies

1. Initialize the Go module if it is not already initialized:
   ```bash
   go mod init <module_name>
   ```
   Replace `<module_name>` with a suitable name for your project.

2. Download the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   go mod tidy
   ```

---

## Step 4: Running the Backend

1. Build and run the project:
   ```bash
   go run main.go
   ```
   Replace `main.go` with the entry point file of the project if it has a different name.

2. Your backend server should now be running. By default, it might be accessible at:
   ```
   http://localhost:8080
   ```

## Step 5: API Endpoints (Optional)

If your project includes RESTful or GraphQL endpoints, refer to the `docs/` or `README` in the repository for details about available API routes.

---

## Troubleshooting

1. **Go Not Found**  
   If you encounter a "command not found" error when running `go`:
   - Ensure Go is installed and added to your `PATH` variable.
   - Restart your terminal after making changes to your environment variables.

2. **Dependency Issues**  
   If you encounter errors related to missing packages:
   - Run `go mod tidy` again to download all dependencies.

3. **Port Already in Use**  
   If you encounter a port conflict, modify the port number in the project's configuration file or directly in the `main.go` file.
